<h3>Hi there! 👾</h3>

I'm **[Yanis](https://yanisbalan.com/)**, a student, software engineer, and degree apprentice from the UK. 

- Full-Stack development 
- Studying BSc in Digital & Tech Solutions
- Degree apprentice for **[@RicohUK](https://www.instagram.com/ricohuk/)**.📍

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as internal apps that save our teams time and energy. I have contributed to major features and automating systems in internal-facing applications.



Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of tech, and I help coaches make more revenue through online sales (cash collected $250k+ and counting).
